# # Library Management System (MySQL Project)

## Description
This project implements a Library Management System using MySQL. It simulates a real-world scenario where a library needs to track books, members, staff, book loans, and fines. The database is designed with proper relational structure, constraints, and normalization.

## Project Structure

- **library_db.sql**  
  Contains the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements to set up the full schema with proper constraints and relationships.

- **ERD-Library_Schema.png**  
  An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) visualizing all entities, their attributes, and relationships.

## How to Run the Project

1. Open MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client.
2. Import and run the SQL script using:
   ```sql
   SOURCE path/to/library_db.sql;

This will create all tables with correct primary and foreign key constraints.
